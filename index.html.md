Why use this app?
========================================================
* Acquiring data on the outbreak is not trivial; the WHO does not offer downloads of e.g. CSV files.
* Consequently, data was scraped off the Wikipedia site on the outbreak. 
* This procedure is fully reproducible and would allow an app such as this to serve as a source of up-to-date 
information on the spread of the virus.
